1.	What kind of data is this device collecting? What sensors are used? Where is the data being stored and who has ownership over the data? Is the data available to the user, and if so, in what format? 

Kolibree collects three kinds of data which are personal data, web tracking data, and brushing data. The personal data includes the personal information offered by the customer while they purchase the product. This includes email address, name, home address and others. However, credit card information is not collected by Kolibree. It is not offered to third parties for commercial purposes. The web tracking data includes cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs used on the website. It also includes the web browser that the customers use and the IP address of the customer. Brushing data is also collected and it is anonymized and used in researches such as behavioral studies. 
3D motion sensors are detecting the dental structure and sending it to the smartphones by Bluetooth. The ownership is over Kolibree and offered to the users. It is an open platform allowing third parties such as your dentist to obtain the customers’ information if they give consent. The information is offered in the Koliree application. 

2.	How far can you trace the path of the data? How far can you trace the physical development of the device, its materials and manufacture?
The pdf attachment shows the path.

3. Task: Replicate and Replace, Critique

The data is sent to Kolibree's website and the company has all the data. The application offered in Apple Store and Android is created by Kolibree so the company obtains all the data. The only third party that can have the people that we share the information with consent such as our dentists. However, annoynimized data is freely given to research institutions. Annoynymized data can be de-annoynmized with complicated procedure. Customers' personal data can be leaked to these research institutions. Therefore, it is crucial for users to have control of their data. The data is traced up to Kolibree's website control subdivision which is Kolibree SAS. 
If I could change a functionality to allow users to take control of ownership of the data, I would give more quick options for users to give or not give consent on the application. The application should have a quick setting to turn on and off for enabling brushing information to be given to professionals or not. It should also ask  the consent for annoynimized data to be given to third parties or not. 
The toothbrush is already motivating users to brush their teeth carefully in a fun way with games on the application. The techniques that we discussed in class such as using sensors and lights seem to motivate users into visually seeing where they need to brush more. The lights will show up in the mouth where brushing is needed more and this will allow users to brush that area. The lights can be showed by the tooth brush.
